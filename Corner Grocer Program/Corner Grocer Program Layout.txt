Need: Program that analyzes the text records produced throughout the day

Records Job - List items purchased in chronological order from store open to store close

Customer want? - to rearrange the produce section and learn how often items are purchased 

Program Requirements:
1.Produce a list of all purchased items in a day + number of times each item was purchased
2.Produce a number that represents the number of times a item was purchased in a day
3.A text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a day + number of times each item was purchased


Additional Task - Write a explanation of the codes design and fucntionality.

Code in C++
Develop a menu that ask user what they would like to do
+ options
 - 1.Produce a list of all purchased items in a day + number of times each item was purchased
 - 2.Produce a number representing number of times a item was purchased in a day
 - 3.A text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a day + number of times each item was purchased
 - 4.Exit

Requirement 2 - Create code to determine the frequency of a specific item
 + Use C++ to validate user input for option 2 in the menu. Prompt a user to input the item, or word, they wish to look for. Write a C++ function to take the userâ€™s input and pass it to Python.
 + Write a C++ function to display the value returned from Python. Remember, this should be displayed on the screen in C++. We recommend reviewing the C++ functions that have already been provided to you for this work.


Code in Python
Requirement 1 - Create code to determine the number of times each individual item appears
 + Function 1 (itemCount)- Display the number of times each item/word appears
 
 
Requirement 2 - Create code to determine the frequency of a specific item
~ Function 2 (itemFrequency) - Calculate the Frequency each item/word that appears from the input file (code exist from previous assignement) - use return 
     + Write Python code to return the frequency of a specific word. It will be useful to build off the code you just wrote to address the first requirement. You can use the logic you wrote but modify it to return just one value; this should be a fairly simple change (about one line). Next, instead of displaying the result on the screen from Python, return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word to C++.
     +
     +

Requirement 3 - Create code to graphically display a data file as a text-based histogram.
~ Function 3 (itemValue) - Display the final result of items and their corresponding numeric value 
~ Function 4 (showhistogram) - Create code to graphically display a data file as a text-based histogram.
     + Use C++ to validate user input for option 3 in the menu. Then have C++ prompt Python to execute its relevant function.
     + Write a Python function that reads an input file (CS210_Project_Three_Input_File, which is linked in the Supporting Materials section) and then creates a file, which contains the words and their frequencies. The file that you create should be named frequency.dat, which needs to be specified in your C++ code and in your Python code. Note that you may wish to refer to work you completed in a previous assignment where you practiced reading and writing to a file. Some of your code from that work may be useful to reuse or manipulate here. The frequency.dat file should include every item (represented by a word) paired with the number of times that item appears in the input file. For example, the file might read as follows:
Potatoes 4
Pumpkins 5
Onions 3
     + Write C++ code to read the frequency.dat file and display a histogram. Loop through the newly created file and read the name and frequency on each row. Then print the name, followed by asterisks or another special character to represent the numeric amount. The number of asterisks should equal the frequency read from the file. 


For example, if the file includes 4 potatoes, 5 pumpkins, and 3 onions then your text-based histogram may appear as represented below. However, you can alter the appearance or color of the histogram in any way you choose.
Potatoes ****
Pumpkins *****
Onions ***
