# Grocery Tracker
**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
This project aimed to help the client determine the purchase frequency of specific items.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I believe I created a user-friendly menu that meets the client's requirements precisely.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
One way to enhance my code is by making it case-insensitive, allowing the end-user to use any capitalization when selecting an item from the text file. This improvement would increase the codeâ€™s efficiency and user-friendliness.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
What I found most challenging was writing the histogram. I struggled to represent the number of times an item was purchased using asterisks instead of numbers.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
Skills such as proficiency in multiple languages are transferable and will enhance your capabilities in various other areas of work.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I ensured the code is well-organized and added detailed comments throughout.
