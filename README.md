# Integrating-Languages
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This project was to assist the client in figuring out how often an item is purchased. 

What did you do particularly well?
- I feel I created a easy to ready menu and provided the client with what they asked for. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- One way I could I enhance my code is by making it so that the end-user can use any capitalization and the code will be able to select the item from the txt file. This would make the code more efficient. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- What I found most dfficult to write is the histogram. I was unable to get the number of times a item was purchased to be represented with astricks vs a number. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- Skills like using two languages will transfer to other works. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I made sure to keep the code clean and provide notes within the code.
